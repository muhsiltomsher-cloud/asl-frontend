## About

Aromatic Scents Lab is a UAE-based luxury fragrance house founded in 2021. We handcraft premium perfumes, oud oils, body care products, and home fragrances using the finest natural ingredients sourced from around the world — including authentic Arabian oud, French rose, Indian sandalwood, musk, and amber.

We create truly one-of-a-kind fragrances with the most innovative and sustainable technologies. By offering fragrances to inspire, captivate and beautify, we develop an invisible fragrant bond with our customers.

We began our fragrance journey in 2021, as a UAE-based fragrance boutique, with quite a simple mission — to create statement-making fragrances with the highest quality ingredients. We produced fine fragrances with proficiency to shape that experience into a fragrance line that combines personal care and air care.

We curate stories that are radical and addictive, in every creation of our collection, through an endless array of products for self-care and home care with perfumes, hair mist, fragrance oil, candles, diffusers, and air fresheners. All our fragrances are completely handcrafted by a single ingredient, with the luxury of experiencing it in a single whiff.

### Our Mission

Our mission is to deliver a unique aromatic experience that lasts long and leaves an unforgettable impression. From luxury perfume gift sets to reed diffusers, candles, and hair mists, every Aromatic Scents Lab creation is designed to captivate your senses and elevate your everyday moments.

### Our Journey

From our humble beginnings to becoming a recognized name in the fragrance industry, our journey has been one of continuous learning and innovation. We travel the world to source the finest ingredients, from the lavender fields of Provence to the oud forests of Southeast Asia. Each ingredient is carefully selected to ensure the highest quality in every bottle.

### Our Collection

Our collection features a diverse range of fragrances, from timeless classics to modern interpretations. Whether you prefer the warmth of oriental notes, the freshness of citrus, or the elegance of floral bouquets, we have something for every taste. Each fragrance is crafted with precision and care, using traditional techniques combined with modern innovation.

### Our Promise

We are committed to excellence in everything we do. From the quality of our ingredients to the craftsmanship of our bottles, every detail matters. We promise to deliver fragrances that not only smell exceptional but also reflect our dedication to sustainability and ethical sourcing. Your satisfaction is our ultimate goal.

### What Makes Us Unique

We are a timeless brand and believe that the real richness lies in simplicity and quality while creating a product that can be appreciated by both domestic and foreign clients. An exclusive and admirable olfactory wardrobe is built by the most talented perfumers with the finest and rare raw materials. We love simplicity, and our vintage-look packaging along with displays convey to you the bare essence of our fragrance.

## Key Ingredients

Our fragrances feature premium natural ingredients, each carefully selected for their unique characteristics:

### Arabian Oud
Sourced from Southeast Asian oud forests, the heart of our oriental fragrances. Oud (also known as agarwood) is one of the most precious and expensive natural ingredients in perfumery. It has a deep, complex, woody aroma that forms the backbone of many Arabian fragrances. Our oud is sustainably sourced and carefully aged to develop its rich character.

### Vanilla
An ever-popular fragrance note that seduces the senses, warm and sweet. Vanilla has been a beloved ingredient in perfumery for centuries. Its comforting, gourmand quality adds warmth and depth to fragrances. We use the finest vanilla extracts to create rich, indulgent scent profiles that linger beautifully on the skin.

### Musk
Ethical and unique, derived from natural sources, a timeless perfumery ingredient. Since classical times, people have used scented ingredients derived from nature to make fragrances. Our musk notes are sourced ethically and provide a clean, sensual base that enhances and extends the life of our perfume compositions.

### Leather
A sophisticated note with a history dating back thousands of years in perfumery. Perfumes and leather have been inseparable historically, with the link dating back about 2000 years. Our leather accords are crafted to evoke the rich, warm character of fine leather, adding depth and sophistication to our compositions.

### Amber
Comforting and warm, a classic base note in perfumery. Amber provides a rich, golden warmth that anchors fragrances and gives them longevity. Our amber accords combine resinous, sweet, and slightly powdery notes to create an enveloping, luxurious feel.

### Sandalwood
Indian sandalwood, relaxing and calming. Prized for thousands of years in Eastern cultures, sandalwood brings a creamy, woody smoothness to fragrances. We source our sandalwood sustainably to ensure both quality and environmental responsibility.

### French Rose
Delicate floral notes from the rose fields of Provence. The rose is often called the "queen of flowers" in perfumery. Our French rose absolute captures the full, rich, and romantic character of the Provence roses, adding elegance and femininity to our compositions.

### Florals
Light and refreshing floral bouquets. Our floral compositions range from single-note soliflores to complex bouquets, each designed to capture the beauty and freshness of nature's most beloved blooms — from jasmine and iris to neroli and ylang-ylang.
