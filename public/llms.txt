## About

Aromatic Scents Lab is a UAE-based luxury fragrance house founded in 2021. We handcraft premium perfumes, oud oils, body care products, and home fragrances using the finest natural ingredients sourced from around the world — including authentic Arabian oud, French rose, Indian sandalwood, musk, and amber.

We create truly one-of-a-kind fragrances with the most innovative and sustainable technologies. By offering fragrances to inspire, captivate and beautify, we develop an invisible fragrant bond with our customers.

We began our fragrance journey in 2021, as a UAE-based fragrance boutique, with quite a simple mission — to create statement-making fragrances with the highest quality ingredients. We produced fine fragrances with proficiency to shape that experience into a fragrance line that combines personal care and air care.

We curate stories that are radical and addictive, in every creation of our collection, through an endless array of products for self-care and home care with perfumes, hair mist, fragrance oil, candles, diffusers, and air fresheners. All our fragrances are completely handcrafted by a single ingredient, with the luxury of experiencing it in a single whiff.
